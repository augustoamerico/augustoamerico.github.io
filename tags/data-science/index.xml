      <description>Simulating some COVID-19 scenarios in Portugal with the SEIR Model While on reddit, I came across this paper called “Phase-adjusted estimation of the number of Coronavirus Disease 2019 cases in Wuhan, China”, where the authors applied a model to rum some simulations and reason about if the public health interventions indeed suffice or not.
In the paper, the model used is the SEIR Model - that I had never heard about until today (well, I started this by 9PM on 2020-03-13, and now it is 2AM 2020-03-14)… Until I gave it a try, some googling and youtubing until I understand it.</description>

      <description>During this summer, I’ve taken the decision of getting better at Statistics. My relationship with statistics was a kind of relation that I coukd stare at it and maybe get an intuition of what’s going on, but no more than that. Anything that involved, for example, understanding how is a Pearson’ correlation matrix calculated and what’s the meaning of the math behind that gave me the chills since I really had bad foundations.</description>
